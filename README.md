scalastudy-private
==================

For private scala study. Nothing interesting will be here.

My Plan List:
* (Even better) wiki-like parser to make latex-beamer and/or javascript-based presentation
* Scala-based EXI handler samples (using OpenEXI)


Externals (what's the smartest way to do good external jar reference?)
* lib/nagasena.jar: OpenEXI nagasena build (under Apache Licence)
